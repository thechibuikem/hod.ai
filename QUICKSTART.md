# HOD Q&A System

An AI-powered Question & Answer system for the Department of Computer Science, Nnamdi Azikiwe University. Students can ask departmental questions and receive instant, accurate answers — without waiting for the HOD.

Built with **TypeScript · Express · Gemini AI · ChromaDB**.

---

## How it works

A student types a question. The system cleans it, converts it to a semantic vector using Google's embedding model, searches the knowledge base for the most relevant answers, and passes the results to Gemini to generate a natural language response. The whole process takes 2–5 seconds versus a 90-minute HOD wait.

```
Question → Preprocess → Embed → Vector Search → Retrieve Context → Generate Answer
```

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have all of the following installed before continuing.

| Requirement | Version | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 18 or higher | `node -v` |
| npm | 9 or higher | `npm -v` |
| Python | 3.8 or higher | `python3 --version` |
| pip | any | `pip --version` |
| Git | any | `git --version` |

---

## 1. Get your Gemini API key

The system uses Google's Gemini API for both embeddings and answer generation. It is free with no credit card required.

**Important:** You must create the key from AI Studio, not from Google Cloud Console. A Cloud Console key will give a `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` error.

1. Open **https://aistudio.google.com/apikey** in your browser
2. Sign in with a Google account
3. Click **Create API key**
4. On the dialog that appears, click **Create API key in new project** — do not link it to an existing Cloud project
5. Copy the key that appears. It starts with `AIza...`
6. Store it somewhere safe — you will need it in Step 4

---

## 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hod-qa-backend.git
cd hod-qa-backend
```

---

## 3. Install Node.js dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Or create it manually and paste the following:

```env
# Server
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:5500

# Admin
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-secret-admin-key

# Google Gemini — paste your AI Studio key here
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...

# ChromaDB (local)
CHROMA_URL=http://localhost:8000
CHROMA_COLLECTION=hod_knowledge_base

# Pipeline
TOP_K_RESULTS=3
```

Replace `GEMINI_API_KEY` with the key you copied in Step 1.

---

## 5. Install and start ChromaDB

ChromaDB is the local vector database. It runs as a separate Python server process.

**Install ChromaDB via pip:**

```bash
pip install chromadb
```

If you are on a system where `pip` points to Python 2, use:

```bash
pip3 install chromadb
```

**Start the ChromaDB server:**

```bash
chroma run --path ./chroma_store
```

You should see:

```
Starting Chroma server on http://localhost:8000
```

Leave this terminal running. Open a new terminal for the remaining steps.

> The `./chroma_store` folder is where ChromaDB persists your vector data. Do not delete it or your ingested knowledge base will be lost and you will need to re-run ingestion.

---

## 6. Run knowledge base ingestion

Ingestion reads `data/knowledge_base.json`, converts each entry into an embedding vector using Gemini, and stores it in ChromaDB. You only need to run this once — or again whenever you update the knowledge base.

```bash
npm run ingest
```

Expected output:

```
Loaded 100 knowledge base entries.
No existing collection found, creating fresh.
Embedded 1/100: Clearance
Embedded 2/100: Graduation
...
Embedded 100/100: General

Ingestion complete. Inserted: 100, Skipped: 0
```

If you see `Skipping entry due to error` messages, check that:
- Your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` is correct
- The ChromaDB server is running on port 8000
- You created the key from AI Studio, not Google Cloud Console

---

## 7. Start the backend server

Open a new terminal (keep the ChromaDB terminal running):

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

---

## 8. Open the frontend

Open `index.html` directly in your browser. No build step or server needed.

On most systems you can do:

```bash
# macOS
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html

# Windows
start index.html
```

Or simply drag the file into a browser window.

You should see the HOD Q&A interface. Type a question and click **Ask**.

---

## API endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Server and DB liveness check | None |
| `POST` | `/ask` | Submit a question, get an AI answer | None |
| `POST` | `/flag` | Flag an answer for HOD review | None |
| `POST` | `/admin/ingest` | Re-ingest the knowledge base | `X-Admin-Key` header |
| `GET` | `/admin/flags` | List all flagged answers | `X-Admin-Key` header |

### Test with curl

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health

# Ask a question
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the requirements to clear final year?"}'

# Flag an answer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/flag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "test?", "answer": "test answer", "reason": "seems wrong"}'

# View flagged answers (admin)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/admin/flags \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-secret-admin-key"

# Trigger re-ingestion (admin)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/admin/ingest \
  -H "X-Admin-Key: your-secret-admin-key"
```

## npm scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | `node --loader ts-node/esm` | Start dev server with hot-ish reload |
| `npm run build` | `tsc` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm run start` | `node dist/index.js` | Run compiled production build |
| `npm run ingest` | `ts-node run_ingest.ts` | Ingest knowledge base into ChromaDB |
| `npm run test` | `ts-node src/test.ts` | Test each pipeline stage individually |

---

## Updating the knowledge base

The knowledge base lives in `data/knowledge_base.json`. Each entry has three fields:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What are the requirements to clear final year?",
    "answer": "You must complete all registered courses, submit your final year project, pay all outstanding fees, and obtain clearance from the library and departmental secretary.",
    "category": "Clearance"
  }
]
```

Valid categories are: `Graduation`, `Project`, `Clearance`, `Registration`, `Extra-Year`, `General`.

After editing the file, re-run ingestion:

```bash
npm run ingest
```

---

## Deployment

Deployment support is coming. For now the project runs fully locally.

To share a demo, run the backend locally and open `index.html` in any browser on the same machine.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`API key should be set when using the Gemini API`**  
Your `.env` file is not being loaded before the Gemini client initializes. Make sure `import 'dotenv/config'` is the first line in your entry file.

**`403 PERMISSION_DENIED — ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`**  
Your API key was created from Google Cloud Console instead of AI Studio. Go to **aistudio.google.com/apikey**, create a new key in a new project, and replace it in `.env`.

**`404 — models/text-embedding-004 is not found`**  
Wrong model name for the current SDK version. The correct model is `gemini-embedding-001`.

**`429 — Quota exceeded`**  
You have hit the free tier daily limit for the model. Switch to `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` in `generate.ts`, or create a new Google account and generate a fresh AI Studio key.

**`Cannot find module ... /routes/health`**  
TypeScript module resolution is misconfigured. Make sure `tsconfig.json` has `"module": "NodeNext"` and `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"`, and all local imports end with `.js`.

**`chroma run: command not found`**  
ChromaDB was not installed correctly. Run `pip install chromadb` again, or try `pip3 install chromadb`. If still not found, try `python3 -m chromadb.cli run --path ./chroma_store`.

**Page reloads when submitting a question or flag**  
Add `e.preventDefault()` to the button click handlers in `index.html`.
