/**
 * health.ts - Health check endpoint
 * 
 * This is a simple endpoint that tells if the server and database are
 * working properly. It's used by:
 * - Frontend to check if backend is online
 * - Monitoring systems to verify the service is healthy
 * - Docker/containers to check if the app started correctly
 * 
 * GET /api/v1/health
 * Returns: { status: "success", data: { vector_db: "connected", timestamp: "..." } }
